XMakemol2
=========

XMakemol is a mouse-based software, written using the LessTif widget set, for viewing atomic and other chemical systems. It reads XYZ input and renders atoms, bonds and hydrogen bonds.

XMakemol2 was created from the original XMakemol software to fill in the need to manipulate/operate a XYZ file.

If you are looking for the original XMakemol software, please visit its website at http://www.nongnu.org/xmakemol/. There you will also find documentation for XMakemol's original features (which are fully preserved in XMakemol2).
