* XMakemol Problems

This file contains descriptions and solutions to known problems.

** Parsing XYZ files

If XMakemol has problems parsing XYZ files, then it may be because of
the setting of the LANG environment variable. Assuming you are using a
bash-like shell, try launching the program with:

    $ LANG=en_GB xmakemol

** Saving XPM files

With OpenGL rendering you might get unexpected results, like seeing
cutouts in your XPM image where any windows overlapped the main
drawing area.  A workaround for this problem, if you are using
XFree86, is to enable a backing store in your /etc/X11/XF86Config-4:

    Section "Device"

            [...]

            Option              "BackingStore"
    EndSection

If this is successful, then in your /var/log/XFree86.0.log file you
should see lines like:

    (**) TRIDENT(0): Option "BackingStore"
    (**) TRIDENT(0): Backing store enabled
    
** Undo/Discard operations after having added/deleted atoms

If you try to undo a operation after having added/deleted an atom, it
is very probable that the molecule will break or that XMakemol will 
crash. The only solution is to add/delete atoms before or after 
starting a series of operations.

** Reflecting using (0,0,0) as on of the points to form the plane

If you try to reflect using the origin as one of the points to form the plane the molecule WILL
break. There is no known of solution at the moment.
