List of things to do (in no particular order):

o Bounding box improvements (specify vertices or angles/lengths); also
  write EPS bounding box code.

o Add more GL features (e.g., axes).

o Add a button to deselect the radiobox in the rotation window

o Change the order in which atoms are selected for the reflection (select those that are going to be reflected first)

o Add a multiplier option to the translation
